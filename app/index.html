            Hello and welcome. I'm a software developer living in South Florida.
            Most of my experience has been in web development, but I'm flexible and can do pretty much anything.
            When I'm not programming, I'm playing video games or making stupid videos about them.
        </p>

        <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I've created a few applications in my free times for personal reasons. These are some of my favorites.
        </p>
        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>
                <a class="project-title" href="https://carlosfdez.github.io/videocrop/">VideoCrop</a><br>
                <p>
                    When I record videos, I have a large number of footage I need to sift through before editing.
                    I created a video preview and cropping tool that that can cut without a retranscode.
                    It allows me to reduce my footage and hard disk usage before I begin video editing.
                    This was my first attempt at a native desktop application.
                    Written in <em>C++</em> and <em>Qt</em>.

                <p>
                    A custom bot for the <a href="https://discordapp.com/">discord</a> chat client.
                    It's used primarily to play audio clips from various online sources (including Youtube) in voice chat rooms.
                    Written in <em>Python</em> using the <em><a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">discord.py</a></em> library.

                <p>
                    Contribution: Added a universal search to an existed Android application written in Java that provides data about
                    the game <em>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</em>. Also contributed a few other bug fixes and tweaks.

                <a class="project-title" href="https://github.com/sarenji/pokebattle-sim">PokeBattle Sim</a>
                <p>
                    Contribution: Helped with a failed Pokemon Battle Simulator for those that wanted quick online matches
                    without the time burden of creating teams using the actual game.
                    The simulator was written in <em>CoffeeScript</em> running on <em>NodeJS</em>, and used Backbone for the front end.
                    Project owners lost interest especially with <a href="http://pokemonshowdown.com/">Pokemon Showdown</a> maintaining a large user share.
